      <p class="center">
        Perpetual Motion Machines are something that have caught everyone's attention since childhood. What is so fancy about these machines is that these can run by themselves until kingdom come but only in an idealistic situation. 
      </p> 
      <br>
      <p class="center">
        Our Box2D simulation, "Until Kingdom Come" is a serious attempt to simulate this.

          It all begins with an exiting simulation waiting to be run...

      <h3>The Ball Bearing Clock</h3>
      <p>
        The Ball Bearing Clock is the first perpetual machine to go into action. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This consists of a lift on the right which continuously carries balls from the bottom to the top. Once on top it slides down and fills into the first bucket. Each slot, when full, unloads into the inclines which are arranged in such a way that a new ball lands into a bucket only when the slot above it unloads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the top most slot measure some unit of time. Also, each slot counts a unit of time which is a fixed multiple of the unit of time measured by the slot above it.

      <h3>The Spring System</h3>
      <p>
        The Spring, the push hammer and the double-striking pendulum were indegenous elements we used to make the simulation interesting. These elements took some effort to code and synchronize, especially the spring.

      <h3>Fluid Dominos</h3>
      <p>
        Dominos are formed with glasses and filled fluid using balls. "Dominos"... hence they fall sequentially into the fluid filled continer below.

      <h3>The Over Balanced Wheel</h3>
      <p>
        Possibly designed by Da Vinci, this machine works because the left part of the wheel has longer lever arms and larger moment about the centre. This turns the wheel left.
        It is initialized during the simulation by one of the blocks flying of from the double-striking pendulum.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <h3>The Felloe Rim Machine</h3>
      <p>
        Here, the essential idea is that the weight rolling in compartment between the felloe and the rim creates more moment about the centre on the descending side than the ascending one
